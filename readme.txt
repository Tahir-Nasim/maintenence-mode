Set your site to Maintenance Mode to take it offline temporarily (status code 503), or to Coming Soon mode (status code 200), until it's ready to launch. 

== Description ==

The **Website Maintenance Mode** plugin allows site administrators to take their WordPress site offline for maintenance or set it to a Coming Soon mode for visitors. Administrators can still access the website through a private link while it is in maintenance mode.

### Key Features:
- **Enable/Disable Maintenance Mode**: Easily toggle maintenance mode on or off.
- **Private Access Link**: Generate a private access link for site administrators or developers to bypass the maintenance mode.
- **Countdown Timer**: Add a countdown timer or animation to show the time remaining until the site is back online.
- **Custom Maintenance Page**: Display a custom maintenance page with a message to your visitors.

This plugin is ideal for:
- Taking your site offline temporarily for updates.
- Displaying a "Coming Soon" page while you prepare to launch your website.
